<p>I am a <strong>second-year undergraduate</strong> in <a href="http://eecs.northwestern.edu">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.economics.northwestern.edu/">Economics</a> at Northwestern University. My interests broadly relate to behavioral economics, entrepreneurship education, technology policy, design ethics, human-computer interaction, and their many intersections.</p>
<p>I am originally from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GaFUOQWi9A">Youngstown, Ohio</a>.</p> 

<h3>Experience</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I am <strong>co-director</strong> of <a href="launchnorthwester.com/">Launch</a>, a <strong>student-run startup incubator</strong> focused on helping <strong>first-time entrepreneurs</strong> get their own venture off the ground. When the program is not running, I help lead curriculum development and recruitment. When it is running, I speak on topics related to the design process, market and competitor evaluaitons, product-market fit, MVP development, customer interviews, and much more. I also get to act as a mentor for teams during and after the program, which is easily the best part.</li>
	<li>I <strong>founded</strong> <a href="https://getlinknote.com/">LinkNote</a>, a company working on solving the problem of <strong>personal knowledge management</strong> for college students. This is a ton of fun as I get to work on everything from product development to marketing and customer acquisition.</li>
	<li>I am also a <strong>research assistant</strong> at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/">Kellogg School of Management</a> under professor <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/Directory/Kouchaki_Maryam/">Maryam Kouchaki</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Service</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I sit as a <strong>board member</strong> of Northwestern's <a href="https://northwesternues.weebly.com/">Undergraduate Economics Society</a> where I help brainstorm, organize, and publicize events that would be beneficial to Economics undergraduates at NU, such as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/207325593378179/"> Stock Trading Crash Course </a> and an Economics <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/323363781513351/">student mentorship program</a>.</li>
	<li>Finally, I serve as Executive Vice President of the <a href="http://numcsa.strikingly.com/"> Muslim-cultural Students Association</a>. My focus is bringing quality <strong>Muslim speakers and public figures</strong> to campus in order to <strong>spark dialogue</strong> around issues that are important to our community and are capable of improving the campus atmosphere as a whole.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellanea</h3>
<ul>
	<li>I'm a huge <strong>hip-hop</strong> fan, but my mixtape hasn't dropped yet. I've played trombone for 9 years.</li>
	<li>I&#39;m a former <strong>Public Forum Debater</strong>. I was the first <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/theosda">Ohio Speech and Debate Association</a> <strong>State Champion</strong> to win as a junior and win runner-up the following year (basically, I peaked in 11th grade).</li>
</ul>
