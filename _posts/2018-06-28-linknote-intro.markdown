# Hello, LinkNote: Your Smart, Personal Knowledge Base

Ideas are a byproduct of connecting knowledge and experiences.

## The State of Information Today
> # … in order for us to truly create and contribute to the world, we have to be able to connect countless dots, to cross-pollinate ideas from a wealth of disciplines, to combine and recombine these pieces and build new castles. — Maria Popova

It’s well known that our brain does not work linearly. It is not a key-value database. It is not a never-ending [room filled with filing cabinets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZQJhvs4amQ).

In the words of Olaf Sporns, a Brain Sciences professor at Indiana University, “The brain is a complex system… The collective actions of individual nerve cells linked by a dense web of intricate c**onnectivity guide behavior, shape, thoughts, form and retrieve memories, and create consciousness**.”

The brain is a network, yet the tools we use to augment it are not.

### Productivity and Information Overload

![We forget 90% of the content we consume within a week of reading it.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Ofn-wtuw_OLMWsIwm5B9fA.jpeg)*We forget 90% of the content we consume within a week of reading it.*

Recent studies have dubbed the term [“the Forgetting Curve,”](http://www.growthengineering.co.uk/what-is-the-forgetting-curve/) which illustrates that we forget *90% of the content we consume within a week of reading it*.

The problem is compounded by the Internet Age. The average American consumes around [12 publications a day](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2017/07/media-use-habits-what-why-when-and-how-people-read-online.php). Much of that is intentionally consumed passively: we don’t really care if we remember funny videos or John Oliver quotes because they are simply entertainment.

However, much of that consumption is done purposefully.

### The Learning Worker

Whether you’re a journalism student, an entrepreneur, a sales manager, or a personal trainer, learning is essential to your day-to-day life. You can’t succeed if you aren’t constantly growing, while still building off of things you’ve learned in the past.

On one hand, as a result of the crazy amounts of content out there, it’s easier than ever to find what you need when you need it.

On the other hand, as we’ve seen above, **it’s really, really hard to remember all of those things.**

But today more than ever, you [have to be a learning worker](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2016/06/07/say-goodbye-to-knowledge-workers-and-welcome-to-learning-workers/#e017ba42f93b). You have to be constantly growing.

And it’s really frustrating to have to waste time finding content or learning a concept that **you know you’ve seen before**.

## Saving and Sharing Are Solved Problems

Above is an overview of today’s most popular applications to save and share content. There are two big things to notice:

1. **Collecting content is a solved problem.** Since the dawn of the read-it-later and note-taking app, collecting all of your content in one place is a solved problem. In particular I’ve been using [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) for a long time, and I can confidently say that the company is *really good* at what they do. The web clipper, the notebook— the Evernote team makes sure that you can save content to their platform no matter what you’re doing.

2. **Sharing content is a solved problem.** Between Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest, and a variety of other platforms, it’s easier than ever to share content with all of your friends and colleagues.

So what’s the problem?

## Our Brains Connect, Our Technology Doesn’t

The LinkNote team is trying to solve one fundamental problem:  ***our digital knowledge bases do not encourage relationships.***

We believe that solving this problem would do five key things:

1. **Amplify creativity.** [Creativity is just connecting things.](https://medium.com/matter-driven-narrative/what-matters-next-creativity-is-just-connecting-things-ebd5f24fb0fd) There is not such thing as an original idea. Rather, we are just piecing together things that we learn until they seem new. It’s one of the amazing skills of the human mind. But *current tools restrict creativity* by forcing pieces of information into static folders rather than allowing them to flow freely in a network, exposing links that we may not have seen otherwise.

2. **Expand our capacity for recall.** We can’t memorize everything we want to. There is just too much information and not enough time. In addition, memorization often takes* time and effort*. But guess how [our brain chooses what to remember](https://medium.com/@getlinknote/how-does-our-brain-choose-what-to-remember-59bb650dac16)? That’s right… connections! As we’ve said in a previous blog post, the best way to retain new information is to **actively build connections between the new and the old**.

3. **Eliminate redundant research.**  “I *know*  I’ve seen something about that before, but I don’t remember where.” “I had the BEST idea for this project months ago but I don’t remember where I put it!” By actively connecting everything you save, situations like these become far more rare. Your brain doesn’t work in explicit search terms, and neither should your knowledge management tools.

4. **Organizing is hard and boring.** We already organize everything using folders and tags. Many people have *extensive* tagging systems for their note-taking services that take up a lot of time. But if our brain organizes thoughts for us, why shouldn’t the tools we use to augment it? Building relationships between all of your content automatically means that you no longer need to spend time on filing away your content.

5. **Know who is an expert on what.** If you want your knowledge base to be private, it should be. But if you’re willing to open some of it up to your friends and colleagues, you could instantly know who can fill gaps in your knowledge base through knowledge graph analysis.

## LinkNote: Your Smart, Personal Knowledge Base

That is exactly what LinkNote is working to do, and we would love to have you join us for the ride.

Using Natural Language Processing and cutting-edge Knowledge Graph and Representation research, LinkNote will automatically organize everything you save into a personal knowledge graph. Every note will be linked based on the same “metadata” that our brains use to connect information. And the most relevant information will be displayed to you on demand, as soon as you need it.

**We want you to be your most productive, curious, creative self.**

We are hard at work building our alpha version of the product, and we’ll hope you’ll support us by [joining our waiting list](https://getlinknote.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c341cd1126fa8c20983895033&id=bbd508958b) and [following us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/LinkNoteHQ) so that you can keep up to date with everything we’re doing.

In the coming weeks, we will be regularly posting about specific features that we think you’ll love!

But the best ideas are the ones formed through connection, so **we’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback!** Tweet at us, [email us](mailto:getlinknote@gmail.com), or comment and we promise we will get back to you as soon as possible!

*We hope you’ll help us unlock your brain’s potential.*

Love,

The LinkNote Team
