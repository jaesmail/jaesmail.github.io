# How To Shorten The Time to Learn Anything
I was lucky enough to spend this summer working on a startup I founded last Fall, LinkNote, full-time. There are countless cliches that you’ll _constantly_ hear from startup founders. There is one, however, that I never believed:

“You’ll learn more from working on a startup then you ever will getting your degree.”

To me, it sounded like something founders said to hype up their jobs. Surely nobody _actually_ believed that! If that’s the case, what am I wasting my tuition money on?

My skepticism was definitely warranted. Talk coming out of Silicon Valley is [loaded with hyperbole](https://www.wired.com/story/disruption-is-how-silicon-valley-eats-its-young/). But after trying to build a company (and watching it crumble) for the first time, I finally understood _why_ this ever-repeated bit of wisdom caught on.

To clarify, I still don’t categorically buy the whole idea of startup > college education. They’re certainly not mutually exclusive, and I think they each serve very different roles. A college education can give you a concentrated breadth of knowledge that you might not ever get the opportunity to obtain at any other point in your life.

The key difference, however, is _how_ you learn in each setting. 

## Consumption vs. Discovery
Eric Ties, author of [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898), defines a startup as "a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.” A founder’s primary job is to ruthlessly eliminate uncertainty. A company is always going to face _some_ unknowns, especially early on. But the fewer there are, the less likely you are to fail.

And a founder never _wants_ to fail.

That’s why [Lean Startup Methodology](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) preaches tight feedback loops — the shorter the amount of time between an action and its feedback, the more effectively you can move. You are less likely to waste time doing something wrong. You are able to dive deep into a topic with the confidence that you are on the right track.

That obsession with tightening feedback loops — with finding out if a hypothesis or a strategy is wrong as soon as possible — is critical in the success of startups.

And that’s _exactly_ why working on a startup feels so rewarding. 

Classrooms are built on **consumption**: you receive, absorb, and apply content. Startups are build on **discovery**: you’re uncertain, you hypothesize, and you measure. 

We can argue all day about which setting _actually_ teaches you more in an absolute sense. But the feeling of discovery when working on a startup is unmatched. 

## The 3 Steps to Accelerate Your Learning on Any Topic
Honestly, this isn’t a novel idea. You already know this. Everyone already knows this.

I may have realized the power of feedback loops in the context of a startup, but it certainly wasn’t my first exposure to them. Feedback loops are used as a model in [biology](http://tll.mit.edu/help/feedback-loops), [education](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02602938.2014.881979), your workplace — basically everywhere.

But even though we’re all aware of them, **_we never take full advantage of their full potential_**. We suddenly remember them when we have to: to meet a deadline, to study for an exam, to train employees.

So I spent some time simplifying the idea to a few key steps that I could follow to learn anything as efficiently as I can. Here’s what I came up with:

1. **Turn your learning objectives into measurable goals.** The more specific, the better. Saying, “I want to learn to code” won’t get you nearly as far as saying “I want to learn how to build a web app in Python” (and even that can be narrowed down quite a bit). The key here is to understand what exactly you’re measuring. This will be the “fundamental unit of feedback.” In the previous example, this measurement could the length of time that it takes you to build the web app. Assuming the the end-results are going to be the same, minimizing the time to finish implies maximizing efficiency.
2. **Understand what factors impact your ability to reach your learning objective.**The book [Universal Principles of Design](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592535879/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0) put it best: “A key lesson of feedback lops is that things are connected—changing one variable in a system will affect other variables in that system and other systems.” Whether it’s resources the resources and methods you are using, the advice that you are receiving, or the place that you’re sitting, list every major variable that affects your outcomes.
3. **Optimize like crazy.** Obviously not _too_ crazy, but once Steps 1 and 2 are down you need to constantly reflect on the process. What are you doing right? What are you doing wrong? Have you found better resources?  Where can I get better advice? Every time you tweak something, jump back to Step 1 and make sure that your actions are still aligned with your goal(s).

Shane Parish, author of the Farnam Street Blog, once tweeted:

> The key to getting better is learning from feedback. The problem is that most of us stop looking for feedback when we get good enough.  

To get past “good enough,” we need to be mindful of our own work. We need to be constantly striving to improve. We can’t just wait to be told.

I believe that with this concept in mind, learning anything gets exponentially more efficient. I’ll be keeping everyone posted on how this goes for me. Thoughts?
